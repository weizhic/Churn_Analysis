# Churn_Analysis

A ride-sharing company (Company X) is interested in predicting rider retention. To help explore this question, we have a sample dataset of a cohort of users who signed up for an account in January 2014. The data was pulled on July 1, 2014; we consider a user retained if they were “active” (i.e. took a trip) in the preceding 30 days (from the day the data was pulled). Assume the latest day of last_trip_date to be when the data was pulled. The data is churn.csv in the data folder.

We plan to use this data set to help understand what factors are the best predictors for retention, and offer suggestions to operationalize those insights to help Company X. The task is not only to build a model that minimizes error, but also a model that allows us to interpret the factors that contributed to 
predictions.
